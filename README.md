**Movie Critic website**
I have used technologies such as:
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Express JS
- MongoDB

Movie critic website displays a set of movies from a public API, and we can add new movies and reviews which will get stored in the MongoDB. This DB extracting overall data is pending as of now.

**To run:**
1. npm install (main file and backend folder)
2. node movies.js (to run the server) - move to /backend to run this.
3. npm run dev
